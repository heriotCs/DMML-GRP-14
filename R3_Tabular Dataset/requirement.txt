Baseline Training and Evaluation Experiments

Apply at least three (3) machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, including
Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, Linear Models, Perceptron, and k-Nearest Neighbours.
Note your task can be either classification and/or regression, depending on the topic
and dataset(s) you choose. Evaluate and compare the models in terms of appropriate
metrics for the respective tasks, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F-1, error measures
(like RMSE) and justify their choice. In the case of Decision Trees discuss their practical
applications in the context of the selected datasets/topic (D2-D3).
